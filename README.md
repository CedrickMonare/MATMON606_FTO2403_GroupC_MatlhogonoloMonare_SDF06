In this project we had to create a mobile app using Firebase, CSS and JavaScript by following a tutorial on Scrimba. Most of my customizations were CSS based such as the background color and the add to cart button etc. This project was very tricky for me mostly because I'm still getting used to and learning Javascript, even though I was following a tutorial there are still some stuff that I don't understand yet. I do believe my Javascript skills will improve in due time though and I'm proud that I was able to complete this project even though there are certain elements that I was struggling with.
